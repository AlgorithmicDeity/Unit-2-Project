    <h2>AI in Healthcare, Finance, and More</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is reshaping industries by improving efficiency, decision-making, and the ability to analyze large amounts of data in real time. Here are some of the key areas where AI is making an impact:</p>
    
    <div class="divider"></div>
        
    <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li><strong>Finance:</strong> AI is revolutionizing the financial sector by automating tasks, detecting fraud, and providing personalized banking experiences. For instance, AI-driven chatbots like those used by Bank of America’s Erica assist customers 24/7, answering questions and managing accounts. AI also plays a key role in risk assessment and algorithmic trading, where machines process massive datasets to predict market trends and execute trades faster than any human can.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> In healthcare, AI is improving patient outcomes by aiding in diagnostics and treatment planning. IBM’s Watson, for example, uses AI to analyze medical literature and patient data, assisting doctors in making evidence-based decisions. AI is also crucial in imaging diagnostics, where it can detect conditions such as cancer in its early stages with higher accuracy than traditional methods.</li>

        <li><strong>Daily Life:</strong> AI enhances everyday experiences, from voice-controlled devices to AI-generated content. For instance, Google Photos uses AI to categorize and search images based on objects, locations, or even facial recognition, without needing user intervention. In customer service, AI-driven systems such as chatbots handle routine queries, freeing up human agents to address more complex issues.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> AI is driving the future of autonomous vehicles and smart traffic management. Companies like Tesla and Waymo are at the forefront of developing self-driving cars that rely on AI to interpret sensor data, make real-time decisions, and ensure safety. AI systems are also being used in traffic management to optimize the flow of vehicles, reduce congestion, and improve public transportation efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
