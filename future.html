    <h2>Ethics and Future Predictions</h2>
    <p>As AI technology rapidly advances, it brings both great promise and significant ethical concerns. One of the primary concerns is the potential for AI to replace human workers, particularly in industries like manufacturing, transportation, and even creative fields. The automation of jobs could lead to widespread unemployment unless there are concerted efforts to reskill the workforce and create new opportunities.</p>

    <h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data to operate effectively. This raises concerns about how that data is collected, stored, and used. AI-powered surveillance systems, for example, can infringe on privacy rights if left unchecked.</li>

        <li><strong>Bias and Fairness:</strong> AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data reflects human biases, AI models can perpetuate or even amplify those biases, leading to unfair treatment in areas like hiring, law enforcement, and lending. For example, facial recognition algorithms have been shown to have higher error rates for people of color, which can lead to biased outcomes in policing.</li>

        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Who is responsible when an AI system fails? Whether it's an autonomous vehicle causing an accident or a biased algorithm making discriminatory decisions, the question of accountability is still a gray area in AI governance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Future Predictions</h3>
    <p>Looking ahead, AI is expected to become even more pervasive, with potential breakthroughs in areas such as brain-computer interfaces and fully autonomous robotics. Experts predict that AI will continue to improve, not only in automating tasks but in augmenting human abilities, allowing us to solve complex global challenges like climate change and disease prevention.</p>
