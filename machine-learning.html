    <h2>Understanding Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on creating algorithms that can learn from data and improve without human intervention. At its core, ML allows systems to identify patterns, make predictions, and evolve through experience, making it an essential tool for AI applications.</p>

    <h3>How Machine Learning Works</h3>
    <p>Machine Learning models are trained on datasets that consist of input (features) and output (labels). Through a process called 'training,' the model learns how to map inputs to the correct outputs by adjusting parameters within the algorithm. This learning is typically supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement-based:</p>

    <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The model is trained on labeled data, meaning it knows the correct answer during training. An example is email spam detection, where the algorithm is trained to recognize spam based on labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The model is given data without labeled outputs and must find patterns or clusters on its own. This is used in recommendation engines, where systems identify user preferences without explicit guidance.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The model learns by trial and error, receiving feedback through rewards and punishments. This is common in game-playing AI, like the famous AlphaGo, which learned to play Go by playing millions of games and adjusting its strategy based on wins and losses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applications of Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>Machine Learning is applied in numerous fields, from healthcare diagnostics to self-driving cars. Netflix and Spotify use ML algorithms to recommend content based on user preferences, while Amazon uses ML to optimize logistics and warehouse management. In cybersecurity, machine learning models detect suspicious activity and mitigate potential threats by continuously analyzing network traffic.</p>
